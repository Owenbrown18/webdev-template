  intro: |
    I‚Äôm Owen Brown ‚Äî a software engineering student at the University of Victoria and the person behind OBdesign. I started this business to combine my technical background with a passion for clean, reliable design that helps small businesses make a strong impression online.

    Every website I build is fast, modern, and easy to maintain, created with the same attention to detail I bring to my software engineering work. I focus on clarity, structure, and long-term reliability so each project feels like an investment that lasts. OBdesign is small by design‚Äîpersonal, transparent, and focused on real results.
