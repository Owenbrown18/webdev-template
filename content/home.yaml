  intro: |
    I’m Owen Brown — a software engineering student at the University of Victoria and the person behind OBdesign. I started this business to combine my technical background with a passion for clean, reliable design that helps small businesses make a strong impression online.

    Every website I build is fast, modern, and easy to maintain, created with the same attention to detail I bring to my software engineering work. I focus on clarity, structure, and long-term reliability so each project feels like an investment that lasts. OBdesign is small by design—personal, transparent, and focused on real results.

      We rebuilt the UX around homeowner questions, layered in seasonal promotions, and integrated a scheduling workflow that syncs with the team’s dispatch tools.

      Results included a 46% lift in organic enquiries within six weeks, a faster quoting process, and clearer service differentiation across neighborhoods.
