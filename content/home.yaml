  intro: |
    I’m Owen Brown — a software engineering student at the University of Victoria and the person behind OBdesign. I started this business to combine my technical background with a passion for clean, reliable design that helps small businesses make a strong impression online.

    I've had a passion for front-end development ever since I found out how easily you can go from an idea to a fully responsive user interface. Every website I build is fast, designed to your liking, and easily adaptable for when the time comes you want to adjust yourself. I do my best to focus on clarity, structure, and long-term reliability so each project feels like an investment that lasts.
