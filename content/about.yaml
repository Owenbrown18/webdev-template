      story: |
        I started OBdesign after discovering how much I enjoyed creating websites while learning HTML, CSS, and Tailwind. What began as small personal projects became a way to help local businesses bring their ideas online.
        
        My approach is simple: build sites that are fast, minimal, and reliable — but never afraid to get creative when it fits the client. OBdesign is just me for now, but every project gets my full attention from first idea to final launch.
