      details: |
        Our crew dedicates a full week every spring to tackling accessibility upgrades, weatherproofing, and critical repairs for neighbors who need a hand.

        Partner organizations nominate the homes and facilities, and we supply tools, materials, and licensed supervision so every upgrade passes inspection.

        Volunteers join in daily shifts, receive safety briefings, and leave with a checklist for ongoing maintenance the residents can manage.

        Each cohort includes four on-site shadow days, two deep-dive workshops in our fabrication shop, and stipends that cover starter tools.

        Graduates receive references, OSHA-10 certification support, and introductions to apprenticeship sponsors across multiple trades.
